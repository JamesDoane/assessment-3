The internet works in a sort of cyclical fashion. Servers around the world are constantly running, ready to receive or send information from or to users. These connections flow through many different devices on their way to and from server to end user. 
When a request is made by a user, the infromation is sent from their device to a router which directs the information to a hostname. A hostname is just a nickname however for a destination in the form of an IP address(either in IPv4 or IPv6 format). When a request reaches the intended IP address some sort of server-side actions are executed to return a response to the original user. When users click links it is usually a request of some sort to a server.
